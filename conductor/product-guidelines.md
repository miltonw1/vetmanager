# Product Guidelines

## Interface Tone & Style
- **Flexible Documentation:** Prioritize free-text fields for medical observations, allowing veterinarians the freedom to record notes without rigid constraints.
- **User-Led Accuracy:** Responsiblity for data precision (measures, dosages) rests with the veterinarian; the UI should facilitate entry without over-validating clinical content.
- **Spanish Primary:** The application is designed and localized primarily in Spanish.

## Visual Identity
- **Established Design:** Maintain consistency with the existing UI components and layout.
- **Desktop Efficiency:** Optimize for data density and visibility on desktop web browsers.
- **Note-Taking Focus:** Ensure text areas for clinical notes are prominent and easy to interact with.

## Data & Asset Management
- **Multi-Image Support:** Clinic history entries support multiple image attachments per visit.
- **Chronological Coupling:** Images and clinical notes are strictly associated with the date of the visit to ensure an accurate medical timeline.
- **Isolated Instances:** (Multi-tenancy) Ensure all guidelines support the future goal of clinic-level data segregation.
